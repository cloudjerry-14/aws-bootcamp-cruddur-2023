# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Architectures :
#### 1. Monolithic Architecture : 
A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.
                            
*Refer the below diagram to understand monolithic architecture of a Shopping Application with Inventory, UI, and Payment services all bundled together.

#### 2. Microservices Architecture :
A microservice is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service. Microservices decouple major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases.

*Refer the below diagram to understand microservice architecture of a Shopping Application with Inventory, UI, and Payment services which decouple all major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases which function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole app.

### 6. Played around the AWS console and cloudshell
  + I was playing with cloudshell, I have created a directory with my name and a txt file.

  + I got to know that cloudshell comes with preinstalled aws CLI, Python, git
  + I have then deleted the file and directory
