# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

Architectures :
1. Monolithic Architecture : A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.
                            
                            Refer the below diagram to understand monolithic architecture of a Shopping Application with Inventory, UI, and Payment services all bundled together.

2. Microservices Architecture :A microservice is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service. Microservices decouple major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases.

                        Refer the below diagram to understand microservice architecture of a Shopping Application with Inventory, UI, and Payment services which decouple all major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases which function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole app.
